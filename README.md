# Realix Contracts

Smart contracts for Realix, a platform that tokenizes real-world assets.

This repository contains the core Solidity contracts, deployment scripts, and tests for managing and interacting with tokenized assets on the blockchain.

## Installation

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
SOLIDITY_COVERAGE=true npx hardhat coverage
```
